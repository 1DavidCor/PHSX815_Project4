PHSX815_Project4_FINAL.pdf: This is the writeup for Project #4. 

PHSX815_Project4.py: This script recreates the C/O and Mg/Si distributions plots found in Brewer & Fischer's 2016 publication. The process is outlined in section 4 "Code" of teh writeup.

4 .png files: These are the distribution plots produced by the .py script above. 

Brewer_Fischer_abundance_ratios.txt: This is the full table produced by Brewer & Fischer, 2016. It includes: SPOCS ID, star name, Vmag, derived elemental abundances (C, O, Mg, Si), C/O ratio, Mg/Si ratio, and the number of known planets for the star.

Brewer_Fischer_abundance_ratios.csv: This is the same table as above, now in a .csv format that is readable using pandas.
